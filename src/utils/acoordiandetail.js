    question: 'Is online education as effective as face-to-face instruction?',
    answer:'Online education may seem relatively new, but years of research suggests it can be just as effective as traditional coursework, and often more so. According to a U.S. Department of Education analysis of more than 1,000 learning studies, online students tend to outperform classroom-based students across most disciplines and demographics. Another major review published the same year found that online students had the advantage 70 percent of the time, a gap authors projected would only widen as programs and technologies evolve.',

    question:'How do I know if online education is right for me?',
    answer:'Choosing the right degree program takes time and careful research no matter how one intends to study. Learning styles, goals, and programs always vary, but students considering online colleges must consider technical skills, ability to self-motivate, and other factors specific to the medium. A number of colleges and universities have developed assessments to help prospective students determine whether they are prepared for online learning. You can access a compilation of assessments from many different colleges online.',

    question:'What technical skills do online students need?',
    answer:'Online learning platforms are typically designed to be as user-friendly as possible: intuitive controls, clear instructions, and tutorials guide students through new tasks. However, students still need basic computer skills to access and navigate these programs. These skills include: using a keyboard and a mouse; running computer programs; using the Internet; sending and receiving email; using word processing programs; and using forums and other collaborative tools. Most online programs publish such requirements on their websites. If not, an admissions adviser can help.',

    question:'How do I know if an online degree program is credible',
    answer:'As with traditional colleges, some online schools are considered more credible than others. Reputation, post-graduation employment statistics, and enrollment numbers are not always reliable indicators of quality, which is why many experts advise students to look for accredited schools. In order for an online college to be accredited, a third-party organization must review its practices, finances, instructors, and other important criteria and certify that they meet certain quality standards. The certifying organization matters, too, since accreditation is only as reliable as the agency that grants it. Students should confirm online programsâ€™ accrediting agencies are recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and/or the Council on Higher Education Accreditation before submitting their applications.',
